# mqtt-launcher

_mqtt-launcher_ is a Python program which subscribes to a set of [MQTT] topics and executes processes on the host it's running on. Processes are configured on a per/wildcard basis.


## Requirements

* Python
* [mosquitto.py](http://mosquitto.org/documentation/python/)

## Credits

This program was inspired by [mqtt-exec](https://github.com/denschu/mqtt-exec). I'm not terribly comfortable running NodeJS programs, so I implemented the idea in Python.
